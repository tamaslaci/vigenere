## Vigenére Chiper project
>Study project for my 'cryptography and security' class at the university

This project is about implementing the vigenére chiper's encoding and decoding methods after generating a proper key.
Knowing the above methods and the length of the key the vigenére chiper can be resolved on an appropriately long, secret message.

Sample output:
